A Conversational User Interface (CUI) is a way of interacting humans with computers using NLU and NLP . By CUI you can chat with computers 
as like you do with your friend. These interfaces are being used by chatbots on websites, Voice Assistants like Siri or Alexa, Virtual 
Assistants. While CUIs offer significant advantages in natural interaction and 24/7 availability, they are expected to complement rather 
than to replace Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), with future advancements likely to integrate text, voice, video, and 3D elements for 
richer, more immersive user experiences.
